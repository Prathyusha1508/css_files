            <p>To Kill a Mockingbird was published July 11, 1960, and it immediately became a literature classic. The novel discusses racism in the American South through the perspective of a clever young girl named Jean Louise Finch. The novel features some iconic characters, most notably the sympathetic and just lawyer ‘Atticus Finch’ who changed people’s perspectives and served as role models at a time in the United States when tensions regarding race were high.

                To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1962 and was adapted into a feature movie the following year. The movie won an Academy award in 1962, giving its characters and the story further influence and life over the American social sphere.Many people consider Harper Lee to be one of the most influential authors to have ever existed. She famously published only a single novel up until 2015 when she published its controversial sequel, just before she died</p>

            <h3><u>THE CATCHER IN THE RYE</u></h3>

             <p>The book is written by J. D Salinger and was published in 1951. The novel is centered around the life of the main character, Holden Caulfield after he was expelled from prep school in two days. Disillusioned and confused, Holden begins to search for the truth and rails against the “phoniness” of the adult world.

                The center theme of this classic novel is the “loss of innocence.” The protagonist, Holden, wants to be the “catcher in the rye” -a person who saves children from falling off a cliff. This is a metaphor for entering into adulthood. The name Holden is also significant as it can be read as “hold on.” Holden’s wish is to remain innocent and true in a world full of “phonies” as he puts it.
                
                According to Salinger in an interview, the novel was intended to be a semi-autobiography.

            <p>Initially titled “First Impressions“, this book is fondly regarded as one of the most-loved books among the reading public and literary scholars. This romantic novel of manners was published in 1813 and is written by Jane Austen. This classical novel centers on the turbulent relationship between Fitzwilliam Darcy; a rich aristocratic landowner and Elizabeth Bennet; the daughter of a country gentleman. “Pride and Prejudice” is written with superb character delineation and incisive wit.

                The book takes us into the Regency era in Great Britain, and its humor lies in Jane Austen’s honest depiction of manners, marriage, education, and money during this period. Austen portrayed that world in all pride and prejudice, with unwavering accuracy and satire.This romantic novel of manners was published in 1813 and is written by Jane Austen. This classical novel centers on the turbulent relationship between Fitzwilliam Darcy; a rich aristocratic landowner and Elizabeth Bennet; the daughter of a country gentleman.During the late 18th century, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their daughters – Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia – live at Longbourn, their estate in rural England. Mrs. Bennet, eager to secure suitable marriages for her daughters, is delighted when wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley moves into nearby Netherfield. At an assembly ball, Bingley, his sister Caroline, and his friend Mr. Darcy meet the local society. Bingley and Jane are immediately taken with each other, while Elizabeth instantly dislikes the snobbish Darcy and overhears his dismissive remarks about her.

                Later, visiting the Bingleys, Jane falls ill and must stay to recuperate. While Elizabeth is visiting Jane at Netherfield, she verbally spars with the haughty Caroline and the aloof Darcy. Jane recovers and, soon after, Mr. Bennet's cousin Mr. Collins, a pompous clergyman, visits the Bennets; as the closest male relative, Collins will inherit Longbourn. Mr. Collins intends to propose to Jane, but Mrs. Bennet says she will soon be engaged and consequently suggests Elizabeth, which Collins considers an agreeable alternative. The Bennet sisters also meet the handsome and charming soldier Lieutenant Wickham, whose father worked for the Darcy family. He wins Elizabeth's sympathy by claiming Mr. Darcy denied him his rightful inheritance.

The section begins with Mrs. Ramsay assuring her son James that they should be able to visit the lighthouse on the next day. This prediction is denied by Mr. Ramsay, who voices his certainty that the weather will not be clear. This opinion forces a certain tension between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, and also between Mr. Ramsay and James. This particular incident is referred to on various occasions throughout the section, especially in the context of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay's relationship.

                The Ramsays and their eight children are joined at the house by a number of friends and colleagues. One of these friends, Lily Briscoe, begins the novel as a young, uncertain painter attempting a portrait of Mrs. Ramsay and James. Briscoe finds herself plagued by doubts throughout the novel, doubts largely fed by the claims of Charles Tansley, another guest, who asserts that women can neither paint nor write. Tansley himself is an admirer of Mr. Ramsay, a philosophy professor, and Ramsay's academic treatises.
                
                The section closes with a large dinner party. When Augustus Carmichael, a visiting poet, asks for a second serving of soup, Mr. Ramsay nearly snaps at him. Mrs. Ramsay is herself out of sorts when Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle, two acquaintances whom she has brought together in engagement, arrive late to dinner, as Minta has lost her grandmother's brooch on the beach.
